SongGuessr is a live multiplayer music guessing game. Players will gain points every round by correctly guessing the playing song before time is up!

Players can see other players' guesses. When a player guesses a song correctly, they will gain points. After each song, player scores are displayed in everyone's terminals.

  
### Instructions:
